# Daffodil :sunny:<br> #
### By William Allingham<br> ###
---
Gold tassel upon March's bugle-horn,<br>
Whose blithe reveille blows from hill to hill<br>
And every valley rings **O Daffodil!**<br>
What promise for the season newly born?<br>
Shall wave on wave of flow'rs, full tide of corn,<br>
O'erflow the world, then fruited Autumn fill<br>
Hedgerow and garth? Shall tempest, blight, or chill<br>
Turn all felicity to scathe and scorn?<br>
<br>
**Tantarrara!** the joyous Book of Spring<br>
Lies open, writ in blossoms; not a bird<br>
Of evil augury is seen or heard:<br>
Come now, like Pan's old crew, we'll dance and sing,<br>
Or Oberon's: for hill and valley ring<br>
To March's bugle-horn, Earth's blood is stirred.<br>
<br>
